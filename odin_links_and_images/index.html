    <!-- An anchor tag can be used to link to any resource on the internet, -->
    <!-- mostly HTML documents but also videos, pdfs and images. -->
    <!-- An HTML attribute is needed for the anchor tag to link and is included in the opening anchor tag. -->
    <!-- The HTML attribute comprises a href (hyperlink reference) and a value (the destination) -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    <!-- The above is an example of an absolute link: -->
    <!-- it must contain the protocol and domain to be able to link to other websites-->

    <!-- <a href="about.html">About</a> -->
    <!-- The above is an example of a relative link:-->
    <!-- it does'nt contain the protocol and domain, -->
    <!-- assumption being that the destination  is within the same website and has the same domain-->
    <!-- Only contains file path to the resource relative to the page that you are in -->
   
    <!-- Best Practice is to house index.html in root and other HTML files in own directory -->
    <!-- about.html has been moved to the pages directory and the path updated below -->
    <!-- <a href="pages/about.html">About</a> -->
    
    <!-- Although the updated link above may work, adding ./ ensures that -->
    <!-- the search for the file directory starts relative to the current directory -->
    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

    <!-- Images use a self-closing element <img> -->
    <!-- with the src (source) attribute to determine the origin of the image -->
    <!-- and the alt (alternate) attribute to be displayed if image is not found and for screen readers -->
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="black dog">
